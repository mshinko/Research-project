Gauge the interest of VR equipment with our target markets\\n2. Identify a way to live-stream in VR\\n3. Brainstorm ways to begin website creation\\nProgress\\nDuring this reporting period, we accomplished these tasks:\\n● Refined our target consumers - Developed our ideal target market by\\ncreating 3 theoretical customer profiles based on the 3 customer groups that\\nthe team developed.\\n● Defined our advisory board - Listed nine people that the team would like to\\ninvite to the first project review meeting. Each person has different unique\\ntalents and abilities that could help the team move forward.\\n● Scheduled VR equipment rental - Reserved a VR camera and VR headset at\\nthe Virginia Tech library so that the team can begin testing with the\\nequipment.\\n● Find specific details about 3 competitors - Unable to accomplish this in the\\nweek timeframe. The team decided that the information we already have is\\nenough to move forward with and we spent our resources on other tasks.\\nPlans\\nDuring the next week, we plan to finish these tasks:\\n● Create an interest survey - Use google forms to develop a survey that can\\ngauge the interest in this service based on the 3 target markets defined by\\nFebruary 17th. Generate a list of 9 people (three from each target market) to\\nbe sent out by February 21st. (Kartik, Ryan, Alex)\\n● Obtain and use VR equipment - Receive the VR camera and headset from\\nthe Virginia Tech library and attempt to connect to the computer. See if it is\\npossible to first record a video in VR. Then work on streaming options if time\\npermits for the week. The team will research and document the process for\\nvideo recording and video streaming (if possible). (David, all team)\\n\\nManagement Report.doc 2022Feb13 Page 1/3\\n\\nProblems\\nWe are aware of these problems:\\n● We still do not currently have experience with software / website\\ncreation – Much of the VRSS streaming service is dependent on a reliable\\nstream with easy website access. A lot of our resources will need to be\\nspent on attempting to create an appealing website with streaming\\ncapabilities. However, we are now looking at meeting with people who do\\nhave this experience and developing a plan of integration.\\n● VR equipment implementation requires resources - Although the team\\nwas successful in figuring out a way to rent VR equipment, it has realized\\nthat in order to record and stream video, a powerful and expensive\\ncomputer is needed. It will need to be portable so that it can be moved to\\nwhere the VR cameras are located.\\n● Our marketing efforts/strategy - In order to acquire a lot of customers and\\nproduce sales, our marketing and advertising will need to be phenomenal.\\nWe could develop a social media account (instagram/facebook) and/or\\npay for\\n    ', '\\n    To: VRSS Management Team\\nFrom: David Schlingloff\\nSubject: VRSS Management Report – Week ending March 4th, 2022\\nCopies: Management Team, Advisors\\nPriorities\\nWe are working on these priorities:\\n1. Get people to take our survey and evaluate the results.\\n2. Identify a way to live-stream in VR\\n3. Submit a video to KickstartVT\\nProgress\\nDuring this reporting period, we accomplished these tasks:\\n● Analyzed interest survey results - Received 25 responses from the survey and\\nwrote a one-page report summarizing the key-findings from the survey that was\\nsent out. The team found that we should continue to pursue this product. (Matt,\\nRyan, Alex)\\n● Obtained and use VR equipment - Obtained the Oculus Go and successfully\\nconnected it to YouTube VR. The process was documented and an Oculus Quest\\n2 was scheduled for rent to attempt to do the same thing. If it works as well, then\\nwe will discuss using the Insta360 camera to live-stream to the Oculus Quest 2.\\n(David, Kartik)\\n● Performed individual project reviews - Gave the presentation to our advisory\\nboard members. (David, all team members)\\n\\nPlans\\nDuring the next week, we plan to finish these tasks:\\n● Finalize interest survey results - Synthesize the survey results and add to our\\nreport and project review presentation. (Ryan, Matt, Alex)\\n● Obtain and use VR equipment - Obtain the Oculus Quest 2 and see if it can\\nconnect to YouTube VR. If so, document the process and start to discuss\\nlive-streaming options using the Insta360 camera. (Alex, Kartik)\\n● Perform team project review - Revise presentation template for the class and\\npresent the project review to the team on Wednesday, March 16th. Record the\\ncomments from the Q&A. (David, all team members)\\n● Create a video for KickStartVT - Record and edit a video for KickstartVT and\\nsubmit on Sunday, March 20th. (David, all team members)\\n\\nProblems\\nWe are aware of these problems:\\n● We can only rent equipment for a limited period - We would like to rent an\\nOculus Go or an Oculus Quest (since they are stand-alone devices), but they\\nrequire rentals so timing can get delayed significantly.\\n● We still do not currently have experience with software / website creation –\\nMuch of the VRSS streaming service is dependent on a reliable stream with easy\\nwebsite access. A lot of our resources will need to be spent on attempting to\\ncreate an appealing website with streaming capabilities. However, we are now\\nlooking at meeting with people who do have this experience and developing a\\nplan of integration.\\n● Our marketing efforts/strategy - In order to acquire a lot of customers and\\nproduce sales, our marketing and advertising will need to be aggressive. We\\ncould develop a social media account (instagram/facebook) and/or pay for a\\ncommercial advertisement on TV.\\n    '], 'Summary': ['Week 1 Created the team and MOKR.
