        "      - Perform research online to develop 5 possible competitors (both direct and indirect) to VRSS service by Friday, February 4th (Alex, Ryan, Matt).\n",
        "    - Brainstorm 4 VR streaming-capable cameras:\n",
        "      - Find 4 different types of video cameras (preferably inexpensive, <$1000) that can support VR streaming capabilities by Friday, February 4th.\n",

        "    - We are unsure if cameras can support our bandwidth:\n",
        "      - The team would like to use a limited number of cameras that can be accessed by many different people during a game. The team is unsure if it is even possible to get these types of cameras without spending excessive amounts of money.\n",
        "    - We do not currently have experience with software/website creation:\n",
        "      - Much of the VRSS streaming service is dependent on a reliable stream with easy website access. A lot of our resources will need to be spent on attempting to create an appealing website with streaming capabilities.\n",
