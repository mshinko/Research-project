        "    During this (short) reporting period, we accomplished these tasks:\n",
        "    - Developed the idea and company:\n",
        "      - Brainstormed possible ideas to pursue and decided upon the VR service.\n",
        "      - Created a name for the company (Virtual Reality Sports Seating - VRSS).\n",
        "    - Founded the Team:\n",
        "      - Confirmed 4 teammates (we may accept more in the following days).\n",
        "      - Drafted our MOKRs for discussion.\n",

        "    Plans\n",
        "    During the next week, we plan to finish these tasks:\n",
        "    - Find 5 competitors to the planned VRSS service:\n",
        "      - Perform research online to develop 5 possible competitors (both direct and indirect) to VRSS service by Friday, February 4th (Alex, Ryan, Matt).\n",
        "    - Brainstorm 4 VR streaming-capable cameras:\n",
        "      - Find 4 different types of video cameras (preferably inexpensive, <$1000) that can support VR streaming capabilities by Friday, February 4th.\n",
        "      - Begin understanding the limitations of streaming bandwidth (David, Kartik).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Problems\n",
        "    We are aware of these problems:\n",
        "    - We need to finalize our team:\n",
        "      - There are still people who were interested in joining last week but left too early to make a final decision. We would like to complete this by the end of class on Monday, January 31st.\n",
        "    - We are unsure if cameras can support our bandwidth:\n",
        "      - The team would like to use a limited number of cameras that can be accessed by many different people during a game. The team is unsure if it is even possible to get these types of cameras without spending excessive amounts of money.\n",
        "    - We do not currently have experience with software/website creation:\n",
        "      - Much of the VRSS streaming service is dependent on a reliable stream with easy website access. A lot of our resources will need to be spent on attempting to create an appealing website with streaming capabilities.\n",
